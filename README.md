# POLITEC Technical Test

## ðŸ“š Project
These solutions were coded as a test for the Full Stack Developer Internship role at [POLITEC](https://www.politec.mt.gov.br/)

## ðŸ’» Getting Started
PS: you may need to install TypeScript globally on your machine. To do this, simply copy and paste this into your CLI:
``` $ npm install -g typescript ```

---

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:Will-Andrade/politec_tech_test.git

# Access the project folder
$ cd politec_tech_test

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run tests
$ npm run test

# Run individual tests
$ npm run test fileName
```

## ðŸ§° Chosen Programming Language
I chose TypeScript / JavaScript to solve these exercises simply because it is the language I am most familiar with at the moment. 

## ðŸ“œ Final Considerations
Tests cases and inputs are well documented inside the ```.test``` files. Please, don't hesitate to reach me if you have any doubts about the project.
Finally, simple introductions to each one of my solutions can be found inside the closed pull requests.
